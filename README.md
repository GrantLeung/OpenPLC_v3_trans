# OpenPLC Runtime version 3
OpenPLC is an open-source [Programmable Logic Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller) that is based on easy to use software. Our focus is to provide a low cost industrial solution for automation and research. OpenPLC has been used in [many research papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2014&q=openplc&hl=en&as_sdt=0,1) as a framework for industrial cyber security research, given that it is the only controller to provide the entire source code.
The OpenPLC Project consists of three sub-projects:
1. [Runtime](https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v3)
2. [Programming editor](http://www.openplcproject.com/plcopen-editor)
3. [HMI builder](http://www.openplcproject.com/reference-installing-scadabr)
<br/>
To install:
<br/>
git clone https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v3.git

<br/>
where [platform] can be:
<br/>
